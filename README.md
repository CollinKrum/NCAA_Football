## üìä Data Structure

The application expects game data with the following structure:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "season": 2024,

## üì± Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Firefox  
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Edge
- üì± Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
PORT=3000                                # Server port
NODE_ENV=development                     # Environment mode

# Supabase (provided automatically when using the Vercel extension)
SUPABASE_URL=...                         # or NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...                    # or NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY / service role key

# Upstash Redis (provided automatically when using the Vercel extension)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...
```

When the Supabase credentials are supplied, game data is fetched directly from the configured tables
(`ncaaf_games` and `nfl_games`). If no rows are returned‚Äîor Supabase is not configured‚Äîthe server falls
back to local JSON files and, ultimately, to generated demo data. Upstash Redis powers the shared cache
for API responses; if its credentials are absent, the server degrades gracefully to in-memory caching.

### Data File Locations
- JSON data: `data/ncaaf-games.json`
- Demo data: Auto-generated if no data file found
- Export location: Browser downloads folder

## üìà Performance Optimizations

- **Upstash Redis caching** with automatic in-memory fallback (5-minute refresh)
- **Lazy loading** for large datasets  
- **Efficient filtering** algorithms for real-time updates
- **Chart reuse** to minimize memory usage
- **Responsive design** optimized for mobile performance

## üö¢ Deployment

### GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)
```bash
# Build and deploy to gh-pages
npm run build
git add dist/
git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```

### Full Stack Deployment
- **Heroku**: `git push heroku main`
- **Vercel**: Connect repository for automatic deployments  
- **Railway**: `railway login && railway deploy`
- **VPS**: PM2 process manager recommended
